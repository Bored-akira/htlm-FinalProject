        <h2><b><u> Frontal Lobe</u></b> </h2>
         <p> The frontal lobe is an extremely essential part of your brain. One of the important aspects is it's control of movement through the motor cortex. <br> 
        The motor cortex consists of something called the brocas area which actually allows you to talk. <br> Another aspect of the frontal lobe is it enabling you to have self control. Alcohol is known to weaken the frontal lobe hence reducing self control giving you a pleasurable and confident feeling. <br> Pretty interesting</p>
