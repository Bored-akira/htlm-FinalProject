            <h1> <u><b>Interesting things about Neuroscience</b></u> </h1>
            <p> Hi! I'm pursuing my degree in psychology and wanted to share a few things with you today</p>
            <p> One thing that I have observed is that people are generally capable of naming a few parts of the brain. Yet most fail when to identify how exactly the workload or function of the brain is split <br> between each part of the brain, and that is what I am partially going to help you with today. </p>
