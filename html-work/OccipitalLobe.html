        <h2><b><u>Occipital Lobe</u></b></h2>
        <p> As the name may have suggested for some, this lobe is tasked with object recognition, color perception, depth perception etc. <br>
        The functions of this brain seem more tangible to us as it is crucial for eyesight which is in use for most of us almost constantly. <br>
        This lobe is located around the back of the brain, which would mean any injuries to that part of the brain could lead to impairment in eyesight</p>
